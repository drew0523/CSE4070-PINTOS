/* This library provides data structures for the page replacement
   concepts (a.k.a Swapping). We will use a LRU(Least Recently Used)
   policy for this implementation.
   And note that this 'swap' library will work with 'frame' header file
   in the same directory. Various functions in both libraries will be
   used for performing the second chance (clock) algorithm in this pintOS.

   * You should first allocate a swap disk in the 'vm/build' directory
     by 'pintos-mkdisk swap.dsk --swap-size=n' instruction.
  -> swap.dsk will be automatically attached to the hdb1 while booting.

   * Note that the difference between 'frame' and 'swap' is, functions
     in the 'frame.h' manage the frame table by performing list operations.

     In the contrast, functions in 'swap.h' manage the swap table, with
     'actually' accessing to and working on the swap disk, by using the
     evicted(on LRU) frame prodived from the frame table of 'frame.h'    */
