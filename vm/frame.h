/* As you can see the name of this header file, the main purpose of this
   header is a physical frame allocation, that is, it replaces the naive 
   frame allocation provided by the 'threads/palloc.h' file, with the new
   mechanism that the lazy loading & page replacement concepts applied to.
   
   Thus, in summary, 'frame.h' provides page(frame) allocation routines 
   to users, and inside those routines, page replacement a.k.a swapping
   has been implemented. Let's read sentences right below. */

/* This library provides data structures for the page replacement
   concepts (a.k.a Swapping). We will use a LRU(Least Recently Used)
   policy for this implementation.
   And note that this 'frame' library will work with 'swap' header file
   in the same directory. Various functions in both libraries will be
   used for performing the second chance (clock) algorithm in this pintOS.

   * You should first allocate a swap disk in the 'vm/build' directory
     by 'pintos-mkdisk swap.dsk --swap-size=n' instruction.
  -> swap.dsk will be automatically attached to the hdb1 while booting.

   * Note that the difference between 'frame' and 'swap' is, functions
     in the 'frame.h' manage the frame table by performing list operations.

     In the contrast, functions in 'swap.h' manage the swap table, with
     'actually' accessing to and working on the swap disk, by using the 
     evicted(on LRU) frame prodived from the frame table of 'frame.h'    */

/* Structure below has an information about the frame. You know, this is
   not about the supplemental page table entry, this is about some metadata 
   related to the physical frame. 
   
   * ALERT: Note that the pintOS usually calls '(physical) frame' just
     as 'page'. Thus, the interface of this header like 'alloc_page' uses
     a word 'page', but in fact it's 'frame'. We should keep in mind it. */
